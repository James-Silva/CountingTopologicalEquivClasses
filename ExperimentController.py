# Created Spring 2019
# RUN FROM HERE! Command: python ExperimentController.py
# (FYI: Won't work right away. The variables fileLoc and p_o_FileLoc in Experiment1 need to be changed)
# This is where the program (a.k.a experiements) are run from
# No actual code should go here. Just the main() that calls experiements.
# Disclaimer: Expect some functions to not work perfectly and not be named consistently.
